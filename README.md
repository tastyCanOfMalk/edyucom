# Personal website project
Ultimate goal of website to showcase any coding projects. Website will be made using HTML and CSS initially, with hints of JS. Likely will be heavily bootstrapped to reduce time designing and allow for quick showcasing of portfolio items.

# Pages
- Home/splash/index
	- some kind of general overview of what the site is about
	- Include buttons to bring to random projects?
- About
	- picture/generic bio
	- resume and contact info?
- Projects
	- Use cards/tiles that give each project a name, overview, languages used, link to project itself and/or github link
		- Data cleaning - MAL project
        - Kaggle projects
          - Bakery sales - EDA, market basket
          - Inmate last words - EDA, tidytext
          - Add more?
        - edX Micromasters projects
          - All homework on a single tile?
          - Select best ones, curate
        - Iterations of this website
          - Blog section
          - Photography gallery
          - standard CSS vs SASS implementation
          - etc.
- Photography
	- Galleries of photos

- Blog
	- Select some of the better edX HW assignments to convert to blog posts

	- Contact = contact form + email
    - Still need a spot for the resume?
